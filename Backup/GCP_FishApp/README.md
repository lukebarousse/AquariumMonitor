Abandoned GCP_Fish App as this will not work.  

The intent was to use Google Cloud Build to build the application.
Upon further review, it was found that this does not support a more complex app.
A container is needed to not only house the code but all support a web browser
(i.e., Google Chrome) to utilize a webdriver to go to the website to click 
buttons to light and feed the tank.
